Remember these points when following the coding style:

1. The reason I did not state anything about gotos is because they should not be used, ever. Using them is considered of poor programming practices and they can be avoided by using a few lines of code instead.

2. Labels are usually used with gotos, so read the above comment.

3. Using templates isn't preferred, but you may use them if you wish.

4. When naming fuctions and variables, please use camelCase instead of naming_with_underscores. Although when using QtCreator for GUIs, signals may be names in a similar manner to on_pushButton_clicked().

5. Naming a file should be similar to filename.cpp, and a corresponding header would be called filename.h

6. Commenting syntax is up to you, although be consistent. For long comments, I prefer to use /* */ on a newline. Extremely short comments will usually be on the same line as the code it is "commenting" and is similar to "// Clear window."

7. Every class should have a comment along with it, although the mainwindow class can be considered an exception. Please comment it if you added a function to it.

8. Tabs are 4 spaces. Always.

9. Return values do not usually have parentheses around them, but if the values are made up of an expression, add parentheses.

10. Whitespace - a single blank vertical line separeates fuctions.
