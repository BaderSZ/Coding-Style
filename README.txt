                    *Custom Coding Style*

A custom coding style, made for C++ (other languages coming soon) designed to be readable, neat yet fully functional.

This xml is the coding style export I use for Eclipse CDT. To import,
go to Preferences -> C/C++ -> Coding Style -> Formatter -> Import.

Important Notes:
- Tabs are 4 spaces.
- 'public' 'protected' & 'private' are in the class body.
- Statements within blocks.
- All braces are on seperate lines.

Examples are present in the "/src" folder.
