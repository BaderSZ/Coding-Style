                    *Custom Coding Style*

A custom coding style, made for C++ (other languages coming soon) designed to be perfectly readable and fully functional.

This xml is the coding style export I use for Eclipse CDT. To import,
go to Preferences -> C/C++ -> Coding Style -> Formatter -> Import.

Examples are present in the "/src" folder.
